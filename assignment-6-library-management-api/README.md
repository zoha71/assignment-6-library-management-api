# 📚 Library Management API

A complete REST API for managing a library system built using Node.js, Express.js, Firebase Firestore, JWT authentication, and role-based access control.



## 📌 Project Overview

The Library Management API is a backend application designed to manage library users, books, borrowing and returning of books, and transactions.

The API uses JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization to provide different permissions to Students and Librarians.

Firebase Firestore is used as the database for storing users, books, and transaction information.
